# Yelp-App

**Project Link**: https://yelp-app-pern.herokuapp.com

**Goal**: Learn to build a simple full-stack application and deploy it on the internet.

This is a "code along" PERN stack project I did watching [this freeCodeCamp video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8&t=1091s). It is a simple yelp-like application which allows anyone to add restaurants and upload reviews to any restaurant. My motive was to watch and learn how a full stack application is build from the ground up and to learn the tips and tricks one should keep in mind while building and deploying such application. 

**Tech Stack**

The Frontend is built using React and Bootstrap for the styling. The app wide state is managed using the Context api as Redux would be a bit overkill for this simple application. I've also used 'Font-awesome" for the icons. 

The Backend is built using Node js with Express.js for the server-side application and Postgresql as the database. The server exposes a few REST APIs to fetch and upload restaurants and reviews.



**Deployment** : The app is deployed on Heroku as you probably guessed it from the project link.
